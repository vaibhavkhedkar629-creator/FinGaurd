- **Velocity Checks** - Monitor transaction frequency and amount patterns

### Alert Management
- **Multi-level Alert System** - Low, medium, high, and critical risk categorization
- **Real-time Notifications** - Instant alerts via WebSocket connections
- **Alert Resolution Workflow** - Comprehensive investigation and resolution tools
- **False Positive Management** - Learn from analyst feedback to improve accuracy

### User Behavior Analytics
- **Behavioral Pattern Analysis** - Build comprehensive user spending profiles
- **Location-based Risk Assessment** - Flag transactions from unusual locations
- **Merchant Pattern Recognition** - Identify deviations from normal merchant usage
- **Time-based Analysis** - Detect unusual transaction timing patterns

### Advanced Dashboard
- **Real-time Transaction Monitor** - Live stream of transaction processing
- **Risk Score Visualization** - Interactive charts and trending analysis
- **Alert Management Interface** - Comprehensive alert queue with filtering
- **Performance Metrics** - System health and fraud detection effectiveness

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections via Supabase

## üèó Database Schema

### Tables
- **users** - User accounts with risk profiles and preferences
- **transactions** - Comprehensive transaction data with metadata
- **fraud_alerts** - Generated alerts with risk scores and status
- **user_behavior_patterns** - ML-generated user behavior profiles
- **fraud_rules** - Configurable detection rules and weights

## üéØ Fraud Detection Methods

### Machine Learning Features
- Amount deviation from user patterns (Z-score analysis)
- Time-based anomaly detection (unusual hours/days)
- Velocity pattern analysis (transaction frequency)
- Location-based risk assessment (new countries/cities)
- Merchant behavior analysis (new merchants, risk categories)

### Rule-based Detection
- **High Amount Threshold** - Transactions significantly above user average
- **Unusual Location** - Transactions from new geographic locations
- **Velocity Checks** - High transaction frequency within time windows
- **Time Pattern Analysis** - Night transactions, weekend patterns
- **Merchant Risk Assessment** - High-risk merchant categories
- **Cross-border Monitoring** - International transaction screening

npm run dev
```

## üéÆ Demo Usage

### Quick Start
1. Use the demo login credentials:
   - **Regular User**: `user@demo.com` / `demo123`
   - **Fraud Analyst**: `analyst@demo.com` / `analyst123`

2. Use the Demo Controls panel (bottom-right) to:
   - Start automatic transaction simulation
   - Generate velocity alerts (rapid transactions)
   - Trigger suspicious high-risk activities
   - Clear demo data when needed

### Understanding the Interface

#### Dashboard Overview
